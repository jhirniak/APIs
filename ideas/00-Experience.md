# Experience

Building on the work done in London Hackathon extend it by providing not just information, but actual experience involving even more APIs in the process. Let say you click on a picture of a queen in a post of your friend on Facebook, it gives you range of experiences e.g. walk around Buckingham palace using Google Maps (and optionally also Cardboard), watch queen speech from YouTube (again if with Cardboard in 360 if available), etc.

To not overcomplicate things, each experience could be just a separate service, which if available is included in the experience selection list.

## List of Experiences

* Walk/drive around using Google Maps
* Watch using YT, ...
* See and listen - collect images and play music if with match (e.g. waterfall if seeing Niagara falls)
* VR scans - there are small libraries of scanned items, like e.g. museum exhibition items (will add examples later)
* ...
